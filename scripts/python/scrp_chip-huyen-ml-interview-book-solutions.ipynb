    "I came across Chip Huyen's excellent book on preparing for the [machine learning interview process](https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/), along with over 300 technical questions without solutions. This repo contains a Python script I wrote to extract all these questions and used GPT to generate detailed explanations and sample solutions.\n",
