Predicates
------------
Predicates are used to find a specific node or a node that contains a specific value.
Predicates are always embedded in square brackets.
In the table below we have listed some path expressions with predicates and the result of the expressions:

Path Expression	         Result
/bookstore/book[1]        Selects the first book element that is the child of the bookstore element.
/bookstore/book[last()]

Selecting Unknown Nodes
-------------------------------
Wildcard      Description
*	          Matches any element node
@*	        Matches any attribute node
node()	    Matches any node of any kind

Selecting Several Paths
------------------------
By using the | operator in an XPath expression you can select several paths.

Path Expression	                Result
//book/title | //book/price	    Selects all the title AND price elements of all book elements
//title | //price	              Selects all the title AND price elements in the document
